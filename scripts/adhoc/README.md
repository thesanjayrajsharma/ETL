Ad-hoc Data Load Scripts

The scripts in this folder are designed for ad-hoc data load requests and are not intended for regular, automated use. These scripts serve as tools to load specific datasets into the system based on unique or one-off data requests.

Purpose:
These scripts are generally used to-
Perform data loads for specific, non-recurrent use cases.
Handle custom data import requirements that are not part of the routine ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
Provide flexibility for loading data when regular processes are not applicable or available.
